[![build](https://github.com/linsyking/CanvasHelper2/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/linsyking/CanvasHelper2/actions/workflows/build.yml)

New generation of Canvas Helper backend. Web-based, support Linux, Windows and MacOS.

[Chinese Translation](doc/Readme_ZH.md)

## Requirements

- Python >= 3.7

## Workflow

If you only want to run the backend on your machine and use the frontend on our server, do the following:

1. Follow [documentation](https://github.com/linsyking/CanvasHelper2#run-backend), run the backend at port `9283`
2. Go to <https://canvashelper2.web.app/canvashelper/> to configure your CanvasHelper
3. Go to <https://canvashelper2.web.app/> to see the final result
4. Deploy Canvas Helper on your desktop with [wiget](https://github.com/linsyking/CanvasHelper2/#use-canvashelper-in-)

## Dev Workflow

If you want to setup frontend by yourself or contribute to this project, you have to do mainly 3 steps:

1. Run the backend
2. Run `CanvasHelper2-conf` and configure CanvasHelper in the browser
3. Run an HTTP server to host the static HTML files (or develop your own dashboard frontend)

## Run backend

First, clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/linsyking/CanvasHelper2.git

cd CanvasHelper2
```

Then install the dependencies. It is recommended to use a virtual environment for installation:

```bash
python -m venv env # You may want to change `python` to `python3` or other python binaries
source env/bin/activate # You may want to change the activation script according to your shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you don't want to change any settings (like CORS), you can directly run: (If you want to use frontend on our server, you must use `9283` port)

```bash
uvicorn canvas_app:app --port 9283
```

For development, you probably need to use:

```bash
uvicorn canvas_app:app --reload
```

to automatically reload the api when the script is modified.

If you need to expose the port, you can add option `--host 0.0.0.0`.

## Configure CanvasHelper

If you want to use the frontend on our server, go to: [here](https://canvashelper2.web.app/canvashelper/). (Site might be changed in the future)

Otherwise, go to [CanvasHelper2-conf](https://github.com/linsyking/CanvasHelper2-conf) for more details.

## Preview the result

If you want to see the result without hosting HTML files, you can directly go to [here](https://canvashelper2.web.app/).

You can use any http server you like to host the static html file.

The sample dashboard frontend is at <https://github.com/linsyking/CanvasHelper2-dashboard>.

You can clone that repository and host those files by

```bash
python3 -m http.server 9282
```

Now go to page <http://localhost:9282> to see the result!

## Use CanvasHelper in ...

### Wallpaper Engine

Subscribe template wallpaper: <https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2913474561>.

After you started the backend locally, it will redirect to the [here](https://canvashelper2.web.app/). You can also change it to your local frontend.

To start the backend on startup, you can do the following:

1. Win+R, type `shell:startup`
2. In the opened window, create a file called `canvashelper.vbs`

Its content should be like this:

```vbs
Dim WinScriptHost
Set WinScriptHost = CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
WinScriptHost.Run Chr(34) & "C:\XXX\canvashelper.bat" & Chr(34), 0
Set WinScriptHost = Nothing
```

Replace `C:\XXX\canvashelper.bat` with a better path where you store a `bat` file which is used to launch the CanvasHelper.

**That bat file must be in C drive.**

3. Create that `C:\XXX\canvashelper.bat` file with the following content:

```cmd
@echo off

d:
cd D:\Project\CanvasHelper2
uvicorn canvas_app:app --port 9283
```

Replace `d:` and `D:\Project\CanvasHelper2` with your own directory.

(If your clone directory is in C, then you don't need `d:` to enter drive D)

After that, your system will run this script on startup.

**Note: some features in wallpaper engine are not well-supported, including scrolling.**

### KDE Wallpaper

1. Install [wallpaper-engine-kde-plugin](https://github.com/catsout/wallpaper-engine-kde-plugin).
2. Download the canvas wallpaper <https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2913474561>.
3. You should be able to see the wallpaper.
4. Add a startup script to run the backend.

**Note: scrolling is also not supported.**

## FAQ

- What's the difference between CanvasHelper and CanvasHelper 2?

> CanvasHelper 1 is centralized while CanvasHelper 2 is not. It is completely local so you don't have to connect to our server to use CanvasHelper.
> Moreover, CanvasHelper 2 provides a handy web interface for configuring courses.
> CanvasHelper 2 separates frontend and backend so that you can develop your own dashboard frontend on any operating system/desktop environment.

- What's the relationship between Canvas Helper backend, frontend, and dashboard?

> The backend provides several APIs for frontend and dashboard to call; frontend uses the local APIs to configure Canvas Helper. The dashboard also calls the local backend to get the configuration.

- Do I have to use the sample dashboard frontend?

> No. You can develop your own dashboard frontend. The sample dashboard frontend uses the HTML output from this backend and displays it in a draggable box.
